# My 1st iOS app

My Uni's iOS first assignment (Also my first iOS app that I made)

It's a horsepower converter. It can convert from horsepower (hp) to kilowatts (kW) and in reverse.

For different types of horsepower, the conversion is a bit different:

* Metric horsepower: 1 hp(M) = 735.49875 W = 0.73549875 kW
* Electrical horsepower: 1 hp(E) = 746 W = 0.746 kW
* Mechanical/Hydraulic horsepower: 1 hp(I) = 745.699872 W = 0.745699872 kW

App can run well on iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone 11 (Pro, Pro Max as well) on Portrait mode. App still need to be developed to run on 
landscape mode, also, more iPhone models and iPad.
